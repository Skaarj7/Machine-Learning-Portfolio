# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

- ### Machine Learning Projects

	- [Binary Classification with the Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/binary_classification_titanic.ipynb): An end to end machine learning project that goes among other things through Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, building and evaluating Machine Learning models with a deep focus on the Random Forest Classifier, including Hyperparameter tuning. 
	- [Classification Project](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Classification_Project.ipynb): 
	In this Notebook I covered the basics of how supervised binary & multiclass classification works. I got everything I cover in this notebook from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit_learn & Tensorflow" from Aurelien Geron. I explained every concept in my own words and wrote the code again by myself. I used the famous mnist dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. 
	- [Housing Prices with California Housing Dataset](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Housing-Prices-with-California-Housing-Dataset.ipynb): 
	In this notebook I explained how to tackle a machine learning from the beginning to the end, at the example of predicting housing prices. It covers a lot of tools & techniques, that are common in the machine learning landscape.After reading it, you will know everything you need, to build your own regression system. I got everything I cover in this notebook from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit_learn & Tensorflow" from Aurelien Geron. I explained every concept in my own words and wrote the code again by myself. I used the California Housing Dataset from the statlib repository.

- ### Course Certificates

	- [Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Machine-Learning-Foundations.pdf): Certificate of the Machine Learning Foundations course from the University of Washington on Coursera. This course covered hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies.  I learned how to predict house prices based on house-level features, analyze sentiment from user reviews, retrieve documents of interest, recommend products, and search for images.The course is separated into weeks and these covered the following: Regression: Predicting House Prices; Classification: Analyzing Sentiment; Clustering and Similarity: Retrieving Documents; Recommending Products; Deep Learning: Searching for Images.
	- [Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning](https://github.com/Donges-Niklas/Machine-Learning-Portfolio/blob/master/Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning.pdf): Certificate of the Machine Learning Foundations course from the University of Washington on Coursera.
